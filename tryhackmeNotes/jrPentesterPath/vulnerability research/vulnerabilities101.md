vulnerabilites 101 tryhackme room
one of the questions was to check how many vulnerabilites was published during july 2021... my search filter didn't work as it was too far back so i tried making a script
while i am bad at scripting and have barely made it to work, the script should work, although, interestingly enough it doesn't give the results that were expected as the correct answer for the room
later i realized i used the search wrong, and actually found the correct answer, but in the meantime the script was born... currently, it just spits the output in your terminal and it's ugly
