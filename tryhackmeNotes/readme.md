These are my notes from tryhackme.com
ideally, i will sort them by their respective paths, or something along those lines...
obviously, wherever you can see stuff from their platform, it's THM's IP... these are just my raw, currently, unformatted notes while I was doing rooms or whatever.
I am awful with notekeeping as you can see, but this whole repo is a part of my effort to improve that
